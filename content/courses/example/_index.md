I learnt R programming by myself at least I didn't take courses the first 2 years, it was hard and tough. The whole bioinformatics and/or informatics world was totally unknown, I didn't know anything about communities or summer courses. The first time I opened a terminal I had so many questions and I didn't understand anything. I felt lost but also intrigued and excited to enter a new world that literal can be in your hands. 

The opportunity of learning computer science came also with an internship in Canada. All those months were upside-down and a mixture of happiness and frustration. I didn't know if I was the dumbest student, the language, or just a learning curve. 

My coworkers and PI at the time were the best, they tried to encourage me and let me know I was not alone but I still had those feelings (and I'm still having sometimes). So, whenever I have the opportunity to teach, help or encourage someone to give their first step, I try my best. 

I'm not a "natural" teacher. Oral presentations, talks, and speeches are not my strength, neither are my writing skills (hehe) but I truly believe practice makes the master. 

I have taught some courses and you will find the material and repositories here.
