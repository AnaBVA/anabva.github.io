We created [PulmonDB, a gene expression lung diseases database](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-56339-5) with public transcriptomic high-throuput data and manual curation information with an online interface for a quick accessibility.

Using PulmonDB we are analysing gene expression profiles in COPD and IPF patients to understand better the disease.
