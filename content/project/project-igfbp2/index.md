During my undergraduate studies, I characterized the protein expression of Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein II (IGFBP2) during the develompent of cancer in rat livers using blood and tissue.

In recent years, this collaboration has grown and allowed me to mentor [Itayetzi Reyes](http://www.biomedicina.uabjo.mx/media/18/2021/07/TESIS_CON_OFICIO_DE_IMPRESION_REYES_AVENDA%C3%91O_ITAYETZI_compressed_(1).pdf) on her master's degree project. We studied consistent genes across different studies using a meta-analysis in the development of NASH.
