abstract = "Exploring cellular responses to stimuli using extensive gene expression profiles has become a routine procedure performed on a daily basis. Raw and processed data from these studies are available on public databases but the opportunity to fully exploit such rich datasets is limited due to the large heterogeneity of data formats. In recent years, several approaches have been proposed to effectively integrate gene expression data for analysis and exploration at a broader level. Despite the different goals and approaches towards gene expression data integration, the first step is common to any proposed method: data acquisition. Although it is seemingly straightforward to extract valuable information from a set of downloaded files, things can rapidly get complicated, especially as the number of experiments grows. Transcriptomic datasets are deposited in public databases with little regard to data format and thus …"
